# LUCI ROS2 SDK

This SDK makes the LUCI platform, sensor information and a control interface, available to organizations and leading research institutions, allowing them to use LUCI as a research tool. To use the SDK you will need a LUCI enabled chair updated to LuciCore Sandbox Edition, Version 1.5.2 or greater. If you are interested in gaining access to the Sandbox, contact info@luci.com.

PLEASE NOTE THE SDK IS CURRENTLY CHANGING RAPICDLY DURING DEVELOPMENT

## Overview:

This page documents the overall architecture and design of the LUCI ROS2 Software Development Kit (SDK). It explains how the ROS2 packages provided interact with LUCI and how to use them. It explains what each package is used for and how to call it.

# Overview

LUCI provides this SDK for use of LUCI within the ROS2 ecosystem. LUCI provides multiple deb packages containing message types, executable nodes, and URDF whoâ€™s entire purpose is to get LUCI data into ROS2 compatible formats.

The current features of the ROS2 SDK are as follows:

- Reading of sensor point cloud data

- Reading of linear speed (chair speed from RNet)

- Reading of Joystick position

- Reading of LUCI calculated scaling values

- Writing of Joystick values for remote operation

**Note: Other data streams coming soon**


## Versioning:

The SDK is a combination of multiple individual packages. Each package has its own versioning number. The publicly provided SDK repo is a holding place for examples and package documentation. As a developer using the SDK you will only need to worry about this [repo](https://github.com/lucimobility/luci-ros2-sdk) and version. All binaries in a specific version will be tested against each other before any public release tag is generated.

New tags will be released based on aggressiveness of the changes which may include new support for an upgraded ROS version or the inclusion of new features in the form of additional package binaries.

Versioning is handled on a major.minor.patch method, until the official SDK is released all developers will be using a version < 1.0.0.

As new features are added to individual ROS2 packages their indiviudal repos will be tagged and binaries released to the public via a deb artifactory. 

**A new release of an individual package is not guranteed to cause a release of a new SDK. It will be common practice to hold on a new SDK release until there are multiple changes to multiple packages.**

*Please note that a package binary is not considered compatible or tested with any other ROS nodes other than those listed in its specific SDK release.*


## Package Descriptions:

There are several individual packages that are designed to be independent (though some internal dependencies do exist) so that each package can be run individually depending on the feature set and level of LUCI input needed.
