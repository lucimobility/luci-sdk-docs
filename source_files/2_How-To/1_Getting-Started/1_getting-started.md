# Getting Started

## Setting up your development machine

Due to the nature of the current packages, some require dependencies before they can be installed or run. These packages are built and tested to support ROS2 Galactic with Ubuntu 20.04. New packages can be developed to fit other ROS2 version and OS needs in the future.

The current recommended approaches to getting setup to use the LUCI ROS2 SDK is to install all dependencies manually.

To do this follow the getting started and installation guides here in the documentation.

Note: There is also a provided [`system-setub.sh`](https://github.com/lucimobility/luci-ros2-sdk/blob/main/system-setup.sh) script that has been tested to work on select Ubuntu machines which will automatically install all dependencies need. It is not guaranteed to work on every system however.

Regardless of the method you use to install the SDK dependencies you will still need to install the LUCI ROS2 packages manually with the `apt install` commands listed in [ROS2 Package install](../2_Installation/4_luci-ros2-sdk-install.md)

**If you are installing the SDK manually please follow all the installation sections to get fully set up**
